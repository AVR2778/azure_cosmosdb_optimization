Azure Cost Optimization Strategy for Billing Records

Based on your requirements, I'll propose a tiered storage solution that maintains your API contracts while significantly reducing costs for older, less-accessed data.
Solution Overview
The key approach is implementing a tiered storage architecture:

Hot tier: Keep recent (â‰¤3 months) data in Cosmos DB
Cold tier: Move older data to Azure Blob Storage (cost-effective for rarely accessed data)
Transparent retrieval layer: Handle data fetching from either tier without changing API contracts

Architecture Solution:

Here's how I'd implement this

1. Create a data migration process to move records older than 3 months to Azure Blob Storage
2. Implement a lookup table in Cosmos DB that tracks where each record is stored
3. Modify your read service to check the lookup table and retrieve from the appropriate storage
4. Set up a scheduled Azure Function to handle the tiering process

Architecture Flow

For writes:

All new billing records continue to be written directly to Cosmos DB
No change to existing write operations


For reads:

Service first checks the lookup table in Cosmos DB
If record is in Cosmos DB, retrieve directly
If record is in Blob Storage, retrieve from there
Return data to client in the same format regardless of source


For archival:

Scheduled Azure Function identifies records >3 months old
Copies them to Azure Blob Storage (organized by year/month)
Updates the lookup table in Cosmos DB
Optionally removes the full data from Cosmos DB (keeping only the lookup entry)



Cost Analysis
A quick approximation of savings:

Current: 2M records Ã— 300KB = ~600GB in Cosmos DB
After: Only ~150GB in Cosmos DB (25% of data), 450GB in Blob Storage
Cosmos DB costs ~$0.25/GB/month vs. Blob Storage at ~$0.02/GB/month for rarely accessed data
Potential savings: 450GB Ã— ($0.25 - $0.02) = ~$103/month, increasing as your data grows

Implementation Details

Let me outline the key components and code structures needed:

1. Lookup Table in Cosmos DB
json{
  "id": "record-12345",
  "recordType": "billing",
  "createdDate": "2023-10-15T10:30:00Z",
  "storageLocation": "cosmos",  // or "blob" 
  "blobPath": "billing/2023/10/record-12345.json"  // null if in cosmos
}

2. Data Access Layer

3. Data Migration Function

4. Deployment and Configuration
Infrastructure Setup Scripts

Implementation Steps

Set up infrastructure:

Create a blob storage account for cold tier
Create a new container in your Cosmos DB for the lookup table

Implement the data access layer:

Modify your existing code to use the new BillingRecordService
This layer abstracts the storage location from your API

Deploy the migration function:

Set up a timer-triggered Azure Function
Configure connection to both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage


Initial data migration:

Run a one-time process to migrate existing older records
Validate data is accessible through the new service layer


Ongoing optimization:

The function will run daily to identify and migrate older records
Monitor costs and access patterns


Additional Considerations

Monitoring and alerting:

Set up Azure Monitor alerts for the migration function
Monitor Cosmos DB and Blob Storage metrics


Backup strategy:

Regular backups of the lookup table are critical
Consider point-in-time backups for Cosmos DB


Performance optimization:

Cache frequently accessed old records
Consider Azure CDN for very large records


Cost considerations:

Set appropriate TTL on Cosmos DB documents
Use Cool or Archive tier for very old blob data (>1 year)
